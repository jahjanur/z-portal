Subject: Consultation Request - Z-Portal Project Demonstration

Dear Professor,

I noticed on your website that there is a slot available for online consultation tomorrow. However, when I tried to book through consultations.finki.ukim.mk, I see that Fridays are not available for scheduling.

As we discussed, I have successfully connected to the database you provided access to. I have established the SSH tunnel connection and can now access the PostgreSQL database (db_202526z_va_prj_ecore) using the credentials you shared.

Additionally, I have a working prototype of the Z-Portal project management system. The application includes:

- Full-stack implementation with React frontend and Node.js/Express backend
- Database integration with PostgreSQL (connected to the school database)
- User authentication and role-based access (Admin, Worker, Client)
- Core features including task management, invoice handling, client management, domain management, and timesheet tracking
- All features are functional and tested

The code has been pushed to my GitHub repository at: https://github.com/jahjanur/ecore_finki

I have also created comprehensive documentation including setup guides, database access instructions, and SSH tunnel configuration for easy deployment and testing.

This is the reason I would like to attend your consultation - to demonstrate the working prototype, show you the database connection, and discuss the implementation with you. I believe it would be valuable to get your feedback and guidance on the project.

Could you please let me know:
1. If the consultation slot for tomorrow is still available, and
2. How I should proceed to book it, given that Fridays are not available through the consultations.finki.ukim.mk system?

Alternatively, if there is another time that would be more convenient for you, I would be happy to schedule accordingly.

Thank you for your time and guidance.

Best regards,
Jahja Nur Zulbeari
